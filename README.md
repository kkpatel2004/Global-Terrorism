# Global Terrorism Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze global terrorism data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The analysis helps uncover patterns, trends, and key insights regarding terrorist activities worldwide.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Used:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- **Source:** [Kaggle - GTD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)
- **Timeframe:** 1970 - 2017
- **Number of Records:** ~180,000
- **Attributes:** Date, Country, Region, Attack Type, Target Type, Weapon Type, Casualties, etc.

## 📊 Objectives
- Identify **global terrorism trends** over the years.
- Analyze **most affected countries and regions**.
- Examine **common attack types and target types**.
- Find correlations between **attack types and casualties**.
- Visualize **hotspots of terrorism**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kkpatel2004/Global-Terrorism.git
   cd global-terrorism-eda
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Highest number of attacks** recorded in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
- **Suicide bombings and armed assaults** are the most common attack types.
- **Civilians, military, and government officials** are the primary targets.
- **Terrorism incidents peaked between 2012-2016**.
- **Middle East & South Asia** are the most affected regions.

## 📌 Visualizations
The project includes:
- Time-series plots for **attack frequency over years**.
- Choropleth maps for **global terrorism hotspots**.
- Bar charts for **most affected countries and attack types**.
- Correlation heatmaps for **attack attributes**.
